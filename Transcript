i think of how we learn as a loop right
so at the top of the loop there's
an experience and that experiences i'm
consuming information
or i'm having a physical experience and
i'm going through something myself
and then we reflect on that loop
so we reflect on the experience so what
is it about the experience what were the
details what were the salient points
what are the variables how do those
variables interact over time
and from that reflection we draw an
abstraction and the abstraction is how
we codify it in our mind
at a level of conscious thought which is
if i'm in this situation here's what
i'll do next time
and then from that reflection or the
abstraction sorry we go
into action and that's the actual but
the result of the action
is an experience and so you can see the
loop go around and around
so often what we consume online when
we're trying to learn something
is the abstraction we consume other
people's here are the things you need to
do
and that's fine and that's great but
what we really need to do is reflect on
those
and and work backwards in that case
right we need the active
reflection we need the mental sort of
work about
what is it about that situation that
worked what is it about that situation
that doesn't work
when is this likely to not work what are
the edge cases and that's how we codify
in our mind
because otherwise what we're doing is
we're just following a recipe and when
the recipe doesn't work
the problem is we don't know why right
so there's a
my friend tim urban has this great
analogy which is the chef in the line
cup
what's the difference between the chef
and the line cook they both follow the
same recipe but the difference is
if things go wrong the line cook doesn't
always know why but the chef does
and that comes from experience and it
comes from your reflection and it comes
from
actively doing and so when you're
learning online i think one of the most
important things is that
consuming the content is enough isn't
enough you need to go put it into
practice and that's your
that's your reflection you need to make
